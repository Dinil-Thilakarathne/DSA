Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science, and understanding them deeply can give you a solid foundation for solving various computational problems. Here, Iâ€™ll outline a step-by-step approach to learning sorting algorithms, covering each major type one-by-one, focusing on:

1. [**Bubble Sort**](bubble/README.md)
2. [**Selection Sort**](selection/README.md)
3. [**Insertion Sort**](insertion/README.md)
4. [**Merge Sort**](merge/README.md)
5. [**Quick Sort**](quick/README.md)
6. **Heap Sort**
7. **Radix Sort**
8. **Counting Sort**
9. **Bucket Sort**
