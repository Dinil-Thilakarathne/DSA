Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science, and understanding them deeply can give you a solid foundation for solving various computational problems. Here, Iâ€™ll outline a step-by-step approach to learning sorting algorithms, covering each major type one-by-one, focusing on:

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Heap Sort**
7. **Radix Sort**
8. **Counting Sort**
9. **Bucket Sort**
